Use this file to explain how your sploit1 works.

The main vulnerability here is also strcpy. 
Similar to sploit0.c 
The difference is in buf - link register size. In this case its 108 bytes. 
And also the matter of examining variables both in bar and foo instead of just foo.
Overall, flow of sploit is the same. We find the target, address of buf, and make ret
to point to the beginning of buf where the shellcode is so it gets executed. We don't
need to know what exactly T1BUFFER is as long as we know distance in bytes between lr and buf.
